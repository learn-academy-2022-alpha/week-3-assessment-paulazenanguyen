# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

I'm so sorry because I really don't know of these answers from the top of my head!!!!
like i really don't know any of these off the top of my head

1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: In my experience we use `this` to call on certain values inside of a react. To call on those values. There are differences when using react and javascript. When we call on we have to use `this`.

  Researched answer: Depending on how the keyword this is used it can refer to many things. One way that I have used recently is to refer to an object. When the keyword this is used in an object method, it refers to the object. I am not sure if I have used it any other way but if you use the keyword alone it refers to the global object. If you were to use it inside a function it refers to the global object as well.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is a javascript library that has a user interface. I would use it because it is very useful. I know I use apps that use react such as facebook and netflix.

  Researched answer: React is a javascript library that creates an interactive UI. Companies like Facebook and Netflix use react because it is a scalable application. Using react can be extremely helpful when it comes down to cutting down development time. For example, react allows developers to create and use components that can be used interchangebly, basically making it reuseable. When something reloads it doesn't refresh the whole page rather it resets that small interaction and isolates it.



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: I don't know the method by that name but I am sure that I have used it before. I know class components are normally followed by constructer(props) and super(props).

  Researched answer: After doing a little research I'm surprised to find out that the lifecycle method required for a react class component is render(). It seems that I may have missed it. When render is called you can get either of these items react elements, array and fragments, portals, strings, numbers, boolean, or null. I found out that render should not modify the component state.



4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: I know that you use JSX during react and you normally use it to "escape" a language. I know one of the difference is that you use a curly bracket as apart of its syntax.

  Researched answer: JSX stands for JavaScriptXml and fun fact it was created as a syntactic sugar for React. When you are writing in JSX you are writing in HTML and javascript together.



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is a package manager and holds thousands of node modules. Each one doesn't interfere with one another but when it comes together it works well with each other. I can't recall what file(s) are modified when you run yarn in a react application.

  Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager and it holds a thousand of node modules. The great things about these node modules is that they are isolated. They don't interfere together but when they are put together it turns out great. The files that are modified are yarn.lock and package.json if I am not wrong. 



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Sadly, I don't know what an anonymous function but I know that function kinda holds the instruction of what to do when coding.

  Researched answer: First and foremost, anonymous function in JavaScript is a function that does not have a name attached to it. The way that it works you won't be able access the function by itself so normally you would have to assign it to a variable. Looking through for my research on this topic. It turns out to my surprise that you can use the function as arguments. When I saw the anonymous function my first impression was that it was not going to be able to be used often.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: it's almost the same concept when you are doing the conditional statements in js

2. Props: first thing first is that props stand for properties. You use props when you want to pass arguments through react components.

3. JavaScript Events: What JavaScript event is. It's either what the browser does or what the interactar does. It's more of an action that a word that can be defined. I'll go ahead and list a few. Web page is done loading or a button was clicked.

4. Object-oriented programming: this is a program short for OOP that relies heavily on concepts of classes and objects

5. Ruby: the creator of ruby Yukihiro Matsumoto wanted to create a coding language that had functional and imperative programming. The focus on the coding language is it's simplicity.
